#Introduction: I have started the course Data and Programming Foundations for AI Skill Path in Codecademy almost 3 years after I started working as an SQL dev., and relearning/remembering Python.
#This is one of the early projects on the path, the course encourages you to share and ask for peer reviews. Here are my new first steps.

#Frida Kahlo Exhibition: You've been hired to work on a retrospective of Frida Kahlo's work at a major museum. 
#Your job is to put together the audio tour, but in order to do that you need to create a list of each painting featured in the exhibit, the date it was painted, and its spot in the tour.
#Use your knowledge of Python lists to create a master list of each painting, its date, and its audio tour ID. 

#Tasks:
#1. First, create a list called paintings and add the following titles to it: The Two Fridas, My Dress Hangs Here, Tree of Hope, Self Portrait With Monkeys
#2. Create a second list called dates and give it the following values: 1939, 1933, 1946, 1940
#3. Zip together the two lists so that each painting is paired with its date and resave it to the paintings variable. Make sure to convert the zipped object into a list using the list() function. Print the results to the terminal to check your work. 
#4. There were some last minute additions to the show that we need to add to our list. Append the following paintings to our paintings list then re-print to check they were added correctly: 'The Broken Column', 1944 / 'The Wounded Deer', 1946 / 'Me and My Doll', 1937
#5. Since each of these paintings is going to be in the audio tour, they each need a unique identification number. But before we assign them a number, we first need to check how many paintings there are in total.
#6. Use the range method to generate a list of identification numbers that starts at 1 and is equal in length to our list of items. Save the list to the variable audio_tour_number and check your work by printing the list.
#7. We're finally read to create our master list. Zip the audio_tour_number list to the paintings list and save it as master_list.
#8. Print the master_list to the terminal.

paintings = ["The Two Fridas", "My Dress Hangs Here", "Tree of Hope", "Self Portrait With Monkeys"]
dates = [1939, 1933, 1946, 1940]

paintings = list( zip(paintings, dates))
#print(paintings) 

paintings.append(('The Broken Column', 1944))
paintings.append(('The Wounded Deer', 1946))
paintings.append(('Me and My Doll', 1937)) 

#print(paintings)

length_paintings = len(paintings)
#print(length_paintings)

audio_tour_number = list(range(1,length_paintings + 1))
#print(audio_tour_number)

master_list = list(zip(audio_tour_number, paintings))
print(master_list)
